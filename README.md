# hard-rock
#Tested with "Coldplay" keyword.
#This keyword has around seven results. and the else remains the same as default if there is not all 10 results by a keyword.
#added 10 functionalities separetely due to shortage of time.
#all the functionality is working fine in local machine. I committed and created the gh-pages branch after adding first song functionality and submitted the code.
#now I have completed adding all 10 songs functionality. But it is causing some problem in the live server. Live site is not showing all the results. I think its a git related issue. Everything is fine on my end.
